file-cleaner
============

Delete files by age from definable directories in python

Intended to be used with task scheduler or cron.

Directories to clean are listed in the .cfg file. There can be any number of directories added.

By the way, just finally starting to learn git, so ignore this.

Hey here I am changing this on a third computer, yay! I wanna be committed!
